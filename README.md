# StayKE - A Real Estate Agency
The project aims to create a platform that allows landlords to list their apartments and properties for rent and for potential tenants to view the available houses and prices. The platform will provide a user-friendly interface for both landlords and tenants to interact with and manage their rental properties.

For landlords, the platform will allow them to create and manage their property listings, including details such as property descriptions, rental prices, and availability dates. They will also have access to features such as tenant screening and management tools to make the process of renting out their properties as efficient as possible.

For tenants, the platform will allow them to browse available properties and filter their search based on their desired location, rental price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other criteria. They will also be able to view detailed property descriptions, photos, and virtual tours of the rental properties, as well as submit rental applications and communicate with landlords directly through the platform.
